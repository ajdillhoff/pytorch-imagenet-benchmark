# ImageNet Training in PyTorch
This implements training of popular model architectures, such as ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG on the ImageNet database.

**NOTE:** This is simply a modified version from (https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet)[] that I use for benchmarking. I recommend starting with the original implementation.
